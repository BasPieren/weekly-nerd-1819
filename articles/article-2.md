# Working With Multiple Developers
When you are a developer you propably have heard/worked with Git and Github. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency ( Git, 2019 ). Github is a software development platform that is build around Git togheter with some of its own functionalities. Now I got a couple of years of expierence working with Git and Github but this was always on my own. During the last project in de @cmda-minor-web I started working on a project with three other people. This provided us with some healthy challenges surrounding Git and Github. 

In this article I will explain why and how we tackeld some of these challenges and help prepare ourselfs for a real life environment.
